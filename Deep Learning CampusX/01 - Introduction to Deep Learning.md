##### What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of AI and ML that is inspired by the structure of human brain.
Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as human would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called Neural Network.

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on *Artificial Neural Networks* with *Representation Learning*.

*Representation Learning* :- Feature learning or Representation learning is a set of techniques that allow a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

Deep Learning Algorithms uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in Image Processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

##### Types of Neural Networks:
There are several neural networks available but we will see main 5 of them:
1. Multi-layer Perceptron
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. Recurrent Neural Network
4. Auto Encoders
5. Generative Adverserial Network
